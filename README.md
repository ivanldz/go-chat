# GoChat

**GoChat** is an ongoing project aiming to develop a chat application in Go using the Gin and Gorm frameworks. The goal is to provide a platform for communication between users, with authentication and message generation among them. This project encompasses only the Backend service; you can find the client in this [repository](https://github.com/ivanleodomin/GoChat-Client).

## Features
- User registration and authentication.
- Real-time message generation between users.
- Secure password handling using hashing and salting techniques.
- Scalability: the application is designed for easy scalability to support large volumes of users and messages.
- High availability: the application can be deployed in high availability environments to ensure user accessibility.

## Technologies Used
The project employs the following technologies:
- Go: programming language used for backend development.
- Gin: web framework used for creating RESTful APIs and routing HTTP requests.
- Gorm: ORM used for database interaction.
- PostgreSQL: database management system used for storing application data.
- WebSockets: protocol used for real-time communication between users.
